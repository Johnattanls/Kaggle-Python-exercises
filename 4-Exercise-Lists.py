# These lists are stored in another list, which starts with the best team and proceeds through the list to the worst team last.  Complete the function below to select the captain of the worst team.

# We're using lists to record people who attended our party and what order they arrived in. For example, the following list represents a party with 7 guests, in which Adela showed up first and Ford was the last to arrive
# 
#     party_attendees = ['Adela', 'Fleda', 'Owen', 'May', 'Mona', 'Gilbert', 'Ford']
# 
# A guest is considered 'fashionably late' if they arrived after at least half of the party's guests. However, they must not be the very last guest (that's taking it too far). In the above example, Mona and Gilbert are the only guests who were fashionably late.
# 
# Complete the function below which takes a list of party attendees as well as a person, and tells us whether that person is fashionably late.

# That's it for lists and tuples! Now you have the baseline knowledge to [learn about loops](httpswww.kaggle.comcolinmorrisloops-and-list-comprehensions), which is where lists and tuples get really interesting.
